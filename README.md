# Computer Architecture Lab

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture Lab** repository. This repository contains VHDL code for various CPU architecture tasks, structured into different labs. Each lab folder is organized to include both the basic files provided for the task and the final submission files.

## Repository Structure

- **Lab_x core**: Contains the initial files provided by Hanan Ribo, including task details and any starter code.
- **Lab_x submission**: Contains the final submission files for the lab, which include the completed VHDL code and any other required documentation.

Each lab folder follows the same structure, where `x` represents the lab number (e.g., Lab_1, Lab_2, etc.).

## Labs

### Lab 1: VHDL Concurrent Code - ALU

**Aim of the Laboratory:**
- Develop skills in VHDL, focusing on code structure, data types, operators and attributes, concurrent code, design hierarchy, packages, and components.
- Gain basic skills in ModelSim, a multi-language HDL simulation environment.
- Refresh general knowledge in digital systems and architecture design.

**Tasks:**
1. **System Design ISA**: Implement various arithmetic, shift, and boolean operations based on a predefined instruction set.
2. **Status Bits**: Implement status bits for overflow, zero, carry, and negative conditions.
3. **System Design Micro-Architecture**: Design a module containing an adder/subtractor, shifter, and boolean logic, ensuring it is tested for different `n` values (4, 8, 16, 32).
4. **Generic Adder/Subtractor Module**: Create a generic adder/subtractor using a ripple carry adder.
5. **Shifter Module**: Design a shifter module based on a barrel-shifter without using forbidden operators.
6. **Test and Timing**: Develop a test bench for the system and analyze timing and outputs.

### Lab 2
- **Lab_2 core**: Initial files and task details for Lab 2.
- **Lab_2 submission**: Final submission for Lab 2.

### Lab 3
- **Lab_3 core**: Initial files and task details for Lab 3.
- **Lab_3 submission**: Final submission for Lab 3.
