# Computer Architecture Lab

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture Lab** repository. This repository contains VHDL code for various CPU architecture tasks, structured into different labs. Each lab folder is organized to include both the basic files provided for the task and the final submission files.

## Repository Structure

- **Lab_x core**: Contains the initial files provided by Hanan Ribo, including task details and any starter code.
- **Lab_x submission**: Contains the final submission files for the lab, which include the completed VHDL code and any other required documentation.

Each lab folder follows the same structure, where `x` represents the lab number (e.g., Lab_1, Lab_2, etc.).

## Labs

### Lab 1 - ALU
- **Lab_1 core**: Initial files and task details for Lab 1.
- **Lab_1 submission**: Final submission for Lab 1.

### Lab 2
- **Lab_2 core**: Initial files and task details for Lab 2.
- **Lab_2 submission**: Final submission for Lab 2.

### Lab 3
- **Lab_3 core**: Initial files and task details for Lab 3.
- **Lab_3 submission**: Final submission for Lab 3.
